## Haiti Article

This repository contains the necessary code to reproduce the article: "Informing Policy Via Dynamic Models: Eliminating Cholera in Haiti". 

### TODO: 

- [ ] Description of theta (vaccine efficacy) in model 2 is missing. It's only in the equation, not even in the table. Make a mention of where this can be found.
- [x] Check that everything in the supplement material is referenced in the ms
- [x] Code has been refactored to calculate in the manuscript the likelihood of Lee et al model 1. Fix the supplemental material so that it doesn't have to redo these computations, then remove redundant comments from ms.Rnw
- [x] Check that all equations end in comma or period, remove unnecessary indentation after equations, and capitalize following text accordingly. 
- [x] Check that all in text citations are refer to the authors rather than the article (eg: in lee20 -> by lee20). 
- [x] Convert urls to xurls in .bib, except for packages. 
- [x] Capitalize title of all articles in .bib.
